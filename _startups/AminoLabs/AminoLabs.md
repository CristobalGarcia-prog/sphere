# About
Amino Labs Inc. was co-founded by designer Julie Legault, based on her thesis research at the MIT Media Lab, 2015. Following a kitchen biohacking event at Media Lab director Joi Ito's house, Julie wanted to replicate the experience to pursue her own research by making with biology. However, after experiencing the difficulties of learning synthetic biology, bioengineering, genetic engineering from textbooks, online material, and feeling ill-at-ease in a traditional life science lab, Julie created a minilab, the Amino One.
